# Critter World
This project is a GUI simulation of a world with critters that move around, eat food, mate, bud, and more. Each critter's actions are governed by a set of rules written in a critter language that is parsed into an AST. The contents of each critter's AST are then interpreted at every time step the world takes. 
This project was written as a part of Cornell University's CS 2112. Please email estherwang01@hotmail.com for access to the full repository - due to academic integrity concerns, I am unable to post the code for public access. 

A5CrittersAndWorld contains several example critter and world files that can be loaded. 
Launch.jar is a jar file that can be run with the command `java -jar Launch.jar` in order to run the GUI. The GUI itself has additional simulation instructions under the "Help" menu tab.
